# convexHullOfIntegers
A C++ program that gets the name of two files, say file1 and file2, as command line arguments and computes, using the Quickhull algorithm, the convex hull of a set of integer co-ordinated points in 2-dimensional space. file1 will contain the input to the program and file 2 is where the program writes the output.
