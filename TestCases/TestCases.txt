Input: twoPoints.txt
Output: ConvexHull:
	P1 = (0, 1)
	P2 = (4, 1)	
Purpose: ensures that two points are stored correctly in the
linked list, it's written to a file correctly, and the recursive base
for the quick hull algorithm is correct.

Input: arbiShape.txt
Output: ConvexHull:
	P1 = (0, 2)
	P2 = (1, 3)
	P3 = (4, 1)
	P4 = (2, 0)
Purpose: ensures that the quickhull algorithm recurses
correctly and inserts Points correctly into the linked
list. 

Input: insidePoints.txt
Output:
Purpose: ensures that  all points inside the convex hull are
discarded and not included when writing the convex hull to a
file. 

Input: verticalHorizontal.txt
Output:
Purpose: ensures that if a point lies on the line between
two other points that it is included in the convex hull

Input: repeatedPoint.txt
Output:
Purpose: ensure that a point is not repeated when the convex
hull is printed out.

Input: worstCase.txt
Output:
Purpose: checks to see if quickhull alogorithm works even in
the worstcase aka n^2.
